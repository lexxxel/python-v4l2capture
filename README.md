Introduction
============

python-v4l2capture is a slim and easy to use Python extension for
capturing video with video4linux2. It supports libv4l to convert any
image format to RGB or YUV420.

this fork of python-v4l2capture: https://github.com/gebart/python-v4l2capture

original python-v4l2capture: http://fredrik.jemla.eu/v4l2capture

libv4l: http://freshmeat.net/projects/libv4l

Installation
============

v4l2capture requires libv4l by default. You can compile v4l2capture
without libv4l, but that reduces image format support to YUYV input
and RGB output only. You can do so by commenting the line:

	libraries=["v4l2"], extra_compile_args=['-DUSE_LIBV4L', ],

in setup.py.

python-v4l2capture uses distutils. To build:

	./setup.py build

To build and install:

	./setup.py install

Examples
========

The script list\_devices.py lists all video4linux devices and it's capabilities
(as seen by python-v4l2capture).

The script capture\_picture.py shows a simple one-shot immediate capture of a
picture. The image is stored to a file "image.jpg".

The script capture\_picture\_delayed.py wait some seconds to allow the
auto-exposure to take place. The image is stored to a file "image.jpg".

The script capture\_video.py takes a video and stores it to a file
"video.mjpg". It stopps after 10 sec of recording automatically.

The program filmroller.py provided a gui to take captures from a webcam. It
switches resolution between lowest resolution (for a live view) and highest
resolution (for the snapshot). It is quite useful to be used with slide and
negative film scanners.
